# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# 1. Python: Widely recognized for its simplicity and efficiency, Python boasts an extensive array of libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning.
# 2. R: Particularly popular for statistical analysis and data visualization, R is highly regarded for its ability to handle tabular data, arrays, and perform complex statistical operations.
# 3. SQL (Structured Query Language): Essential for working with relational databases, SQL enables the extraction, manipulation, and analysis of large data sets stored in databases.
# 4. Java: While not as common as Python or R for data analytics, it's used in certain data science areas, especially in environments that require integration with Java-based applications or for large-scale systems.
# 5. Scala: Mainly used in big data environments, especially with Apache Spark, a popular tool for processing large data sets. Scala combines the functionality of object-oriented and functional languages.

# **Objectives:**
# - Understand and apply basic arithmetic expressions in Python.
# - Identify popular languages for Data Science, including Python and R.
# - Learn to use key Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.
# - Familiarize with the functionality and usage of Jupyter Notebooks in data science workflows.
# - Explore the concepts of version control and the usage of GitHub in managing data science projects.

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 1. Pandas: A foundational library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. Pandas provide easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools, making it ideal for tasks like data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.
# 2. NumPy: Essential for scientific computing in Python, NumPy offers support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It's widely used for numerical data processing.
# 3. Scikit-learn: A key library for machine learning in Python. Scikit-learn provides a range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms via a consistent interface. It's known for its simplicity in implementing complex machine learning models.

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
# ###### Addition
# 3 + 5
# ###### Subtraction
# 10 - 4
# ###### Multiplication
# 6 * 7
# ###### Division
# 20 / 4

# In[1]:


#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5


# In[3]:


#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
print('200 minutes is equal to', 200 / 60, 'hours')
